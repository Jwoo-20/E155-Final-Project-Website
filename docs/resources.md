# Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from the popular Marvel Comics character Iron Man. Further inspiration for the mask opening and closing comes from [here](https://youtu.be/9uIXtODioGM?si=inA8PGjUw7Hp7eMh). The 3D print files for the helmet come from [here](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/iron-man-helmet-articulated-wearable). This project builds on the one from the video by adding a gesture sensor to control the helmet, a keypad to require a code before it becomes functional, and LED eyes that can display different patterns.


# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Professor Brake and Professor Tina for their support and assistance throughout this class as well as the project. Thank you to Hardy Richardson for assisting with 3D printing the helmet and fixing the 3D printers when they broke.
