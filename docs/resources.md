# Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from the popular Marvel Comics character Iron Man. Further inspiration for the mask opening and closing comes from [here](https://youtu.be/9uIXtODioGM?si=inA8PGjUw7Hp7eMh). The 3D print files for the helmet come from [here](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/iron-man-helmet-articulated-wearable). This project builds on the one from the video by adding a gesture sensor to control the helmet, a keypad to require a code before it becomes functional, and LED eyes that can display different patterns.
