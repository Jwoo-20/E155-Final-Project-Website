The FPGACode folder contains all files required to run the FPGA. It contains main.sv, keypad.sv, and ledoutputs.sv. These are uploaded to the UPduino and provide it functionality. The MCUCode contains all the code that is uploaded to the NUCLEO. It includes main.c as well as a variety of other .c and .h (header) files. These other files define constants, addresses, and useful functions.
